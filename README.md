# tsa_project

This is a mini project to gain experience in time series analysis. 

As a dataset, we have data about customers, products, orders, etc. We need to build models to forecast demand over the next 21 days.
For the approach of predicting the behavior of a time series using machine learning methods, it is forbidden to create new data features and use any other than the values of the series itself in order to most correctly compare the two basic approaches in the scenario of not having enough data.
